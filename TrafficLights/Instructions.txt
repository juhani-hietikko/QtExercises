Traffic lights exercise
=======================
Implement a controller for a traffic light system with TDD. There is an API for controlling the hardware units (ITrafficLight and IPedestrianLight interfaces),
the controller subsystem should use these interfaces.

The controller subsystem that you implement must allow using some kind of clock signal as its input, by which it is aware of the passing of time.
Simulate time in your tests.

The traffic lights in this case will be installed to a crosswalk (i.e. a pedestrian crossing on a street). There are traffic lights for cars
and pedestrian traffic lights for pedestrians. The following table specifies how the lights should be set to different states based on time passing:

time (s)  |   car lights    |    pedestrian lights
--------------------------------------------------
0             green              red
30            yellow             red
33            red                green
43            red                green (flashing)
47            red+yellow         red
50            green              red

The above loop continues forever, 50 seconds is again equivalent to 0 seconds.

Start by adding a new test project for your tests.
