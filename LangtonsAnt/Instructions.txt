Langton's ant exercise
======================
Implement a model for the Langton's ant cellular automaton with TDD.

Here's a description of the desired functionality:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant

To be more precise:
You need to implement a grid of cells, where each cell can be set either white or black initially.
You should also be able to place an ant to some cell with some direction (up, right, down or left).
And you should be able to step the system forward, which should move the ant and change cell colors according to the two rules described in wikipedia.

We provide you with a crude GUI (mainwindow.cpp) which you can connect to your implementation (see TODO comments in mainwindow.cpp) to visualize how your implementation works!
(This doesn't mean that you're allowed to replace writing automated tests by doing only manual testing, though!)

This project is for your implementation and another ready project is provided for your tests.
